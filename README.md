# Wigly

A humble library for creating your website or application views.

#### Why

I was rewriting a website of mine. Was aiming for zero dependencies and the least amount of JavaScript to send over the wire. This is what came out.

#### What

It's a view library! Like React/Preact, Vue, or HyperApp. It's my fav bits from React and Vue smashed into one while staying very lean with respect to kb size (the ES6 build is 1.2kb gzipped).

#### Examples

Examples coming soon. API is in flux.
